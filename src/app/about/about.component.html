        <h1>ClaimsKG Statistical Observatory</h1>
        <p>The ClaimsKG Statistical Observatory is a complementary tool to the ClaimsKG search engine. It generates
            graphs and statistics from the data in the ClaimsKG knowledge graph.</p>
        <p>This statistical observatory allows for the visual exploration of various metrics and trends related to
            claims and their verification across the different fact-checking websites included in ClaimsKG.</p>
        <h2>Key Features:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Visualization of the total number of claims and fact-checking reviews over time</li>
            <li>Distribution of truth evaluations (true, false, misleading, etc.)</li>
            <li>Analysis of the frequency of appearance of different entities (people, organizations, locations, etc.)
                associated with the claims</li>
            <li>Evolution of the number of claims by thematic category (politics, health, economy, etc.)</li>
            <li>Comparison of the performance of different fact-checking websites in terms of coverage volume and
                results</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>This statistical analysis tool aims to facilitate the understanding of large-scale fact-checking dynamics and
            trends, relying on the structured and enriched data from the ClaimsKG project.</p>
        <p>Just like the ClaimsKG search engine, the statistical observatory is the result of a collaborative effort
            between French and German research teams. It is made available to the public for research purposes, while
            respecting the copyrights of the source fact-checking websites.</p>
